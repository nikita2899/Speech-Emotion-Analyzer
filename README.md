# Speech-Emotion-Analyzer
Detecting emotions is one of the most important marketing strategies in today’s world. You could personalize different things for an individual specifically to suit
their interest. In this project, we could detect a person’s
emotions just by their voice which will help us manage
many AI-related applications. Natural Language Processing(NLP) is one of the best techniques we can use. Librosa library in python is used to process and extract features from the audio files. Librosa is a python package
for music and audio analysis. CNN model is used for
our emotion classification problem. The model can categorize the voice into 8 different categories-angry, calm,
fearful, happy, sad,surprised,neutral,disgust. Dataset used
is RAVDESS. The architecture is an adaptation of an image processing CNN, programmed in python using Keras
model-level library and TensorFlow back-end. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) uses multiple (deep) layers
of units with highly optimized algorithms and architectures
which results in high accuracy.
